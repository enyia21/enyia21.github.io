My first day in coding boot camp is a source of nervousness and excitement for me.   Like many students who are pulled in multiple directions by family obligations, work, etc. it's hard to pull together ideas that you aren't applying everyday.  Coding in javascript for hundreds of hours seems like a great way to get prepared for life as a front end developer.   I wonder if utilizing ruby on rails will be the backend program I use for the rest of my life or will I hope from one to the other after I complete this program.  I wonder how this program will prepare me for grad school?
