Software engineering was a profession that i decided to study because of the software engineering can create for me.  The displine of Software Engineering will allow me to:
1.  Work in an expanding industry that allows individuals to create products and problem solve with competitive compensation.
2.  The skill of software engineering is transferrable, which will allow me to create oppotunities for people in similar situations to me.  
3.  It will allow me to build the businesses that I've wanted to create.  I believe in using tech to help people be their most successfull and I want to create tools that allow that to happen.  There are several markets that I would target and software engineering is vital to building proper solutions.  
4.  Plus software engineers are essential while bartenders are not.
